five topics related to computing (maybe an interesting looking data structure?!) that interest you, maybe even include a link to a page talking about the topic both in this README file and on the discord channel for this class
- I am interested in a lot of things but mainly in AI, programming for machines and their functionality, data analysis, networks, and security.

five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,
- I think that creating something from nothing can be difficult as I have found in work. When I am given something open ended I have a hard time what is expected. I also have a hard time programming in so many different languages at once. I have multiple CS classes right now and I also work in tech so I program in SQL, C++, and R. I think remembering sytax is hard for me as I have done this before and always get confused. I think it is teaching me to remember a bit better though. I think when it comes to data manipulation I also have a hard time so I want to learn more about that.
